the request was prompted by an earlier report submitted to unon management by unon official on a scheme whereby locally recruited staff members from the nairobibased united nations childrens fundsomalia support centre unicefsomalia obtained unsacco loans by submitting fraudulent letters of appointments to unsacco the primary concern of unon management was that a similar fraudulent scheme might have spread to unon and other nairobi based united nations agencies at the time of the request two idoios investigators were on mission to nairobi on another matter but given the concerns expressed by unon managers the idoios investigators were directed by idoios management to look into this matter with celerity and did so from through february the purpose of this report is to present the findings of the preliminary idoios investigation together with recommendations for appropriate action by unon management,,"['request', 'prompted', 'earlier', 'report', 'submitted', 'unon', 'management', 'unon', 'official', 'scheme', 'whereby', 'locally', 'recruited', 'staff', 'member', 'nairobibased', 'united', 'nation', 'childrens', 'fundsomalia', 'support', 'centre', 'unicefsomalia', 'obtained', 'unsacco', 'loan', 'submitting', 'fraudulent', 'letter', 'appointment', 'unsacco', 'primary', 'concern', 'unon', 'management', 'similar', 'fraudulent', 'scheme', 'might', 'spread', 'unon', 'nairobi', 'based', 'united', 'nation', 'agency', 'time', 'request', 'two', 'idoios', 'investigator', 'mission', 'nairobi', 'another', 'matter', 'given', 'concern', 'expressed', 'unon', 'manager', 'idoios', 'investigator', 'directed', 'idoios', 'management', 'look', 'matter', 'celerity', 'february', 'purpose', 'report', 'present', 'finding', 'preliminary', 'idoios', 'investigation', 'together', 'recommendation', 'appropriate', 'action', 'unon', 'management']","['Mali', 'Somalia']"
idoios could not interview all unicef staff or former staff involved in the fraud for example one staff member passed away and another who had left unicef declined the interview in addition the unicef inquiry was not final and information obtained primarily through the interviews of unicef staff by idoios suggested that there might be more unicef staff involved than initially envisaged during their interviews with idoios the concerned unicef staff confirmed that they misused unicef letterhead and official seal indicated that they forged the signature of a unicef operations officer and that they provided unsacco with incorrect information about the duration of their contracts in order to obtain loans all of them mentioned the ease with which they accessed official unicef stamps stationeries and computers although given the limited responsibilities of some of them for example the drivers such access should not have occurred further most interviewees stated that they acted alone and with one exception all denied that either their unicef or unon colleagues assisted them in their fraudulent activities or had been otherwise aware of or involved in such improper actions,,"['idoios', 'could', 'interview', 'unicef', 'staff', 'former', 'staff', 'involved', 'fraud', 'example', 'one', 'staff', 'member', 'passed', 'away', 'another', 'left', 'unicef', 'declined', 'interview', 'addition', 'unicef', 'inquiry', 'final', 'information', 'obtained', 'primarily', 'interview', 'unicef', 'staff', 'idoios', 'suggested', 'might', 'unicef', 'staff', 'involved', 'initially', 'envisaged', 'interview', 'idoios', 'concerned', 'unicef', 'staff', 'confirmed', 'misused', 'unicef', 'letterhead', 'official', 'seal', 'indicated', 'forged', 'signature', 'unicef', 'operation', 'officer', 'provided', 'unsacco', 'incorrect', 'information', 'duration', 'contract', 'order', 'obtain', 'loan', 'mentioned', 'ease', 'accessed', 'official', 'unicef', 'stamp', 'stationery', 'computer', 'although', 'given', 'limited', 'responsibility', 'example', 'driver', 'access', 'occurred', 'interviewee', 'stated', 'acted', 'alone', 'one', 'exception', 'denied', 'either', 'unicef', 'unon', 'colleague', 'assisted', 'fraudulent', 'activity', 'otherwise', 'aware', 'involved', 'improper', 'action']",[]

procurement department officials concede that at this point there was no further issue and there was no justification not to award the contract to lacresta indeed no justification is provided to la cresta or found in the file it seems that la cresta was not formally informed of the cancellation typically the case officer maintains the responsibility for communicating the cancellation to the vendor in this case there is no correspondence in the case file from procurement to the vendor notifying them of the cancellation a dpko official involved in the process has informed the task force that in conversations with pd in this interim period it was represented to him that pd had expressed a view that there was an issue with lacrestas submission according to the official the procurement department suggested a rebid because of a technicality while the official objected he was told that because the matter is a commercial one it is only within pds prerogative to cancel the bid on the basis of commercial noncompliance this explanation is not persuasive as there was no commercial or technical issue with lacrestas bid dpko had found la cresta to be compliant and the firm was the lowest bidder mr cabrera agrees that the reasoning proffered by pd to the dpko official is not sound but takes issue with any claim participation by him in the exchange or decision,,"['procurement', 'department', 'official', 'concede', 'point', 'issue', 'justification', 'award', 'contract', 'lacresta', 'indeed', 'justification', 'provided', 'la', 'cresta', 'found', 'file', 'seems', 'la', 'cresta', 'formally', 'informed', 'cancellation', 'typically', 'case', 'officer', 'maintains', 'responsibility', 'communicating', 'cancellation', 'vendor', 'case', 'correspondence', 'case', 'file', 'procurement', 'vendor', 'notifying', 'cancellation', 'dpko', 'official', 'involved', 'process', 'informed', 'task', 'force', 'conversation', 'pd', 'interim', 'period', 'represented', 'pd', 'expressed', 'view', 'issue', 'lacrestas', 'submission', 'according', 'official', 'procurement', 'department', 'suggested', 'rebid', 'technicality', 'official', 'objected', 'told', 'matter', 'commercial', 'one', 'within', 'pd', 'prerogative', 'cancel', 'bid', 'basis', 'commercial', 'noncompliance', 'explanation', 'persuasive', 'commercial', 'technical', 'issue', 'lacrestas', 'bid', 'dpko', 'found', 'la', 'cresta', 'compliant', 'firm', 'lowest', 'bidder', 'mr', 'cabrera', 'agrees', 'reasoning', 'proffered', 'pd', 'dpko', 'official', 'sound', 'take', 'issue', 'claim', 'participation', 'exchange', 'decision']",[]
